I became to seldom use social mediums after graduating my uni.
When I was a teenager, I used them a lot, I posted more than 10 tweets everyday, and checked the others tweets everyhours even during the classes.
I posted what I was feeling even if the feeling was aggressive, sad or something implicated, but I was definitly enjoying that.
Looking back, I was just a kid of today, nothing else than it.

But, recently, I literally noticed that checking how others are, posting what I am now, and spending tons of time to them are absolutely waste of time for me. Of course I knew that before since that is really a widely known modern problem, but you know, ðŸ˜….
Social media is like a toxin, just it.

Rather, these days I really love to spend my time to talk with people, binge watch videos on netflix/youtube, stay home, study English, play games, read books, sing and think what i wanna do in the near future, without caring about what others think. Besides I feel free of psychological burdens, am satisfying because I am in progress towards my goal.
