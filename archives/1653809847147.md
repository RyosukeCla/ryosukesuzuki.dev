I became to seldom use social mediums after graduating from my uni.
When I was a teenager, I used them a lot, I posted more than 10 tweets every day and checked others' tweets every hour even during the classes.
I posted what I was feeling even if the feeling was aggressive, sad or something implicated, but I was definitely enjoying that.
Looking back, I was just a kid of today, nothing else than it.

But, recently, I literally noticed that checking how others are, posting what I am now, and spending tons of time with them are absolutely a waste of time for me. Of course, I knew that before since that is really a widely known modern problem, but you know, ðŸ˜….
Social media is like a toxin, just it.

Rather, these days I really love to spend my time talking with people, binge-watching videos on Netflix/youtube, staying home, studying English, playing games, reading books, singing, and thinking about what I wanna do in the future, without caring about what others think. Besides, I feel free of psychological burdens and am satisfied because I am in progress towards my goal.
