You know, there should be a problem that many are in trouble with using type-unsafe router.
In vue-router, react-router, or any other routing libraries for frontend, we've called the router functions with just a string argument.
For eaxmple,

```ts
this.$router.push({
  path: '/url/url',
});
const history = useHistory();
history.push({ path: '/url/url' });
```

Yeah, we've used router functions for page trasition like above. It looks inevitable and we don't think about type-safe-fying, right?
So, I made it type-safe. Of course , I use type-safe routing utilities in production environments for some products.

It's simple.

At first, we define a type-hacked function for defining a route,

```ts
function createRouteDef<Query extends { [key: string]: string } | undefined = undefined>(props: {
  index?: boolean;
  path: string;
}) {
  const key = Math.random().toString(16);
  return {
    key,
    path: props.path,
    index: props.index,
  } as { key: string; path: string; index?: boolean } & { _q: Query };
}
```

where `Query` and `{ _q: Query }` are the keys in this function and these are defined for the references from the types which will be defined later.


Then, we define routing definitions with `createRouteDef` for type inference,

```ts
export const ROUTE_DEFS = {
  INDEX: createRouteDef({
    path: '/',
    exact: true,
  }),
  SAMPLE_PAGE: createRouteDef<{ search: string }>({
    path: '/sample',
    exact: true,
  }),
} as const;
```

where `as const` is important for type infrerence, and `ROUTE_DEFS` type should be,

```ts
const ROUTE_DEFS: {
  readonly INDEX: {
    key: string;
    path: string;
    index?: boolean | undefined;
  } & {
    _q: undefined;
  };
  readonly SAMPLE_PAGE: {
    key: string;
    path: string;
    index?: boolean | undefined;
  } & {
    _q: {
      search: string;
    };
  };
};
```

Finally!, all we shoud do to implement utilities is just to extact keys and `_q` in `ROUTE_DEFS` and use them.

```ts
export type Routes = keyof typeof ROUTE_DEFS;
export type Route<T extends Routes> = typeof ROUTE_DEFS[T];
export type RouteQuery<T extends Routes> = Route<T>['_q'];
export type AppLocation<T extends Routes> = RouteQuery<T> extends undefined
  ? {
      name: T;
      query?: RouteQuery<T>;
    }
  : {
      name: T;
      query: RouteQuery<T>;
    };

/**
 * @example
 * const to = createAppUrl({ name: 'SAMPLE_PAGE', query: { search: 'lorem' } });
 * <Link to={to}>to sample page</Link>
 */
export function createAppUrl<T extends Routes>(arg: AppLocation<T>): string {
  const route = ROUTE_DEFS[arg.name];
  const url = new URL(route.path, location.origin);
  const query = {
    ...(arg.query || {}),
  } as { [key: string]: string };
  Object.entries(query).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    url.searchParams.append(key, value);
  });
  return `${url.pathname}${url.search}`;
}
```

where `RouteQuery` is the type that is extracted from `{ _q: Query }` the `createRouteDef` returns.
Of course you can make very useful type-safe hooks for handling history in react-router-dom using these types above!

It is like a type challenge! isn't it?

### Appendix

Besides, you can create `<Router />` components using `ROUTE_DEFS` like below,

```tsx
const ROUTE_COMPONENTS: {
  [route in keyof typeof ROUTE_DEFS]: React.ComponentType<unknown>;
} = {
  INDEX: lazy(() => import('./pages/index')),
  SAMPLE_PAGE: lazy(() => import('./pages/sample_page')),
}
const ROUTES = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(ROUTE_DEFS).map(([route, def]) => {
    const element = ROUTE_COMPONENTS[route as keyof typeof ROUTE_DEFS];
    return [
      route,
      {
        path: def.path,
        index: def.index,
        element,
      },
    ];
  }),
) as {
  [R in keyof typeof ROUTE_DEFS]: { path: string; index?: boolean; element: typeof ROUTE_COMPONENTS[R] };
};

const App = () => {
  return <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route {...ROUTES.INDEX} />
      <Route {...ROUTES.SAMPLE_PAGE} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
}
```

The notion we want to pay attention to is that the implemention depends on you. This is just an example.
