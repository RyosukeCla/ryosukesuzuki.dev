I was searching how I manage postgresql, trying deploying an application that uses postgresql for testing.
I wanted to use it with less price as possible, since it is for testing.

My colleage tought me that postgresql instance managed by heroku can be used with free plan.
So I set up heroku, got the connection string as `DATABASE_URL`, and was happy. you know, that was awesome!

However, it turns out that the credentials which heroku provides are not permanent.

Oh, but I couldn't blame heroku.

Thus, I select to use Cloud Sql for postgresql instance since the application is running on Cloud Run which is not in heroku.

The cost estimation for cloud sql is here.
I set instance type to the most cheapest setting, and select hdd with minimal storage size.

It is about *$9*, and reasonable price for testing environment!
