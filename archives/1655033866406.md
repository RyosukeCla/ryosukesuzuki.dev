And I got brand new surgically modified eyes with clear vision.
My eyesight was around -5D, but is 1.5 now üëÅ.
So I can see everything in the long-distance clearly, although my eyes are still unstable a bit.

During surgery, I was tense because I could see what was happening in front of my eyes directly.
And actually, there was a smell of burning eyes with the laser which is for reducing corneas.

Looking back on that, it was a little frightening, but an exciting experience.
So I definitely recommend you to do this and you will get new eyes and enjoy wearing eyeglasses/sunglasses just for fashion.
