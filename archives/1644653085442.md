title: Migrating database with Cloud Sql before deloying Cloud Run

`Info`: In this post, we assume that we use cloud sql, cloud run, cloud build and secret manager.

## Database migration before deployment.

When we deploy new version of the application, we should care about the state of database not to down the application.
So, we should persist consistency between the state of database and the application code that will soon be deployed.

Cloud Run is a full-managed container runtime, but doesn't have fully customization like kubernetes. For this reason, Cloud Run cannot control out of a process that serves the application.

Thus, we need to think about how we manage the database before deploying new version of the application.
When we use Cloud Build for a deployment operation, Cloud Build is the best option for database migrations.

## Deploy with Cloud Build.

We assume that the current deployment of the application is like below.
This is simple `cloudbuild.yml` that manages the way we deploy.

```yml
steps:
  # build and push
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    dir: '/workspace/'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '-t'
      - '<IMAGE_NAME>'
      - '.'
    env:
      - 'DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1'
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    dir: '/workspace/'
    args:
      - 'push'
      - '<IMAGE_NAME>'

  # deploy
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    dir: '/workspace/'
    entrypoint: gcloud
    args:
      - 'run'
      - 'deploy'
      - '<SERVICE_NAME>'
      - '--image'
      - '<IMAGE_NAME>'
      - '--region'
      - 'us-east1'
images:
  - '<IMAGE_NAME>'
```

## The first step for database migration.

Then, we insert the migration step before the deployment step like this.
The migration script will be executed in container. and we use Secret Managegr for secret key managing.

```yml
steps:
  # build and push...

  # migration
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    dir: '/workspace/'
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        docker run -i --rm \
          -v "/workspace/deployment:/usr/src/deployment" \
          -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/usr/src/credentials/key.json" \
          -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY_FILE=$$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY_FILE" \
          <IMIAGE> \
          sh /usr/src/deployment/db_migrations.sh
    secretEnv: ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY_FILE']

  # deploy...

availableSecrets:
  secretManager:
    - versionName: <GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY_FILE>
      env: 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY_FILE'
```

Notion: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY_FILE` is a key file for a service account that has `Cloud SQL Client` role. And the entrypoint is set to `bash` with `-c` argument since environment substitution works correctly. For more detail, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/use-secrets);

## Connect to Cloud Sql from Cloud Build.

Let's dive into `/usr/src/deployments/db_migrations.sh`.
In the migration step, before excuting migration, we need to run cloud sql proxy for database connection.

At first, we download cloud sql proxy binary.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eux
CURRENT_DIR=$(cd $(dirname $0); pwd)
ROOT_DIR=$CURRENT_DIR/..
BIN_DIR=$CURRENT_DIR/bin

mkdir -p $BIN_DIR

wget https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64 -O $BIN_DIR/cloud_sql_proxy
chmod +x $BIN_DIR/cloud_sql_proxy
```

Then, we execute cloud sql proxy in background.
The notion we want to pay attention to is to set the options correctly.
To reconcile ways of connecting to cloud sql from cloud run and from cloud build, the options shoud be this.

```bash
# write key file to key file path
echo $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY_FILE > $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
$BIN_DIR/cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql/ -instances=<INSTNACE_NAME> -credential_file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS &
```

`-dir` is for unix socket setting, and set it `/cloudsql`. Do not set `=tcp:0.0.0.0:5432` option since we cannot use tcp connection from cloud run to cloud sql.

So, we can connect to cloud sql via the connection string below.

```bash
postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@/<DATABSE>?host=/cloudsql/<INSTNACE_NAME>
```

## Get it done.

Finally, we can execute migration program.

```ts
import { Client } from 'pg';
const migrate = async () => {
  const client = new Client({
    // use environment or secret manager instead of hard coding.
    connectionString: 'postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@/<DATABSE>?host=/cloudsql/<INSTNACE_NAME>'
  });
  await client.connect();
}
```
