I was searching how I manage postgresql, trying deploying an application that uses postgresql for testing.
I wanted to use it with less price as possible, since it is for testing.

My colleage tought me that an postgresql instance managed by heroku can be used with free plan.
So I set up heroku, got the connection string as `DATABASE_URL`, and was happy. you know, that is awesome!

However, it turns out that the credentials which heroku provides are not permanent.

Oh, but I couldn't blame heroku.

Thus, I select to use Cloud Sql for an postgresql instance since the application is running on Cloud Run which is not in heroku.

The cost estimation for cloud sql is here.
I set the instance type to the most cheapest setting, and select the hdd with the minimal storage size.

It is about *$9*, and a reasonable price for an testing environment!
